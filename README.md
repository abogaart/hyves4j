hyves4j
=======

Hyves4j is a Java API that makes it easy to incorporate content from www.hyves.nl (Holland's biggest social networking website) into your own application by wrapping the complexity and logic of OAuth based http requests to the Hyves API, and returning strong typed implementations of Hyves domain models (like users, photos, etc.) to the end user.

Hyves4j depends heavily on the [http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/java/ OAuth Java implementation] for all the OAuth stuff. Also it's project structure and examples helped me a lot in setting up the Hyves4j project.
